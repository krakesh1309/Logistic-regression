## Logistic Regression for Classification
## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for implementing logistic regression, a fundamental algorithm for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression is a linear model used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

## Contents

**Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating logistic regression implementation and usage.

**Scripts**: Python scripts for training, evaluating, and using logistic regression models.

**Data**: Sample datasets used for training and testing logistic regression models.

**Documentation**: Detailed documentation on logistic regression theory, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Notebooks

**Introduction to Logistic Regression**: A beginner-friendly notebook explaining logistic regression theory and implementation using synthetic data.

**Logistic Regression with Real-World Data**: A notebook demonstrating logistic regression applied to real-world datasets for binary classification tasks.
Scripts
**train_logistic_regression.py**: Script for training logistic regression models on provided datasets.

**evaluate_logistic_regression.py**: Script for evaluating trained logistic regression models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**predict_logistic_regression.py**: Script for making predictions using trained logistic regression models.

**Documentation**
